<p>
 Our project will be a labyrinth type puzzle game where the player progresses through a series of computer science related challenges. The player will have 3 attempts to complete each challenge, if successful the player will be rewarded with a clue that will help them escape. At the end of each challenge the player will have a choice on what room they would like to go to next (left or right door) which will affect the forthcoming challenges. On the final level of the game, the player will use the clues they have collected to complete the final challenge and escape the Hackers Labyrinth.
