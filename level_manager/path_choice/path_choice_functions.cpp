// PATH CHOICE FUNCTIONS
// Jasper Charlinski

// Path Choice provides player with two options, left door and right door.
// Behind each door is the chance for the player to receive a power up that will
// help them in preceding level(s), or the chance to receive a draw back that will make
// the preceding level(s) more difficult.
