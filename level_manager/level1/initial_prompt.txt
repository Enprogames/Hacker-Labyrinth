You find yourself in a room with many blocks of different sizes. The blocks are labeled with numbers. It appears that the numbers indicate how many inches tall they are. You hear a voice on a loudspeaker:

“In 2 minutes, acid will begin to rise. It will flood the whole room and dissolve everything in it unless you can find a way to block it from spreading throughout the whole room. Here’s a hint: the acid will rise as high as your highest pair of two blocks stacked together.”
You notice that on the floor there seems to be a long slot across the whole room. The player sees a hole on one side of the slot. Perhaps this is where the acid comes from.

The blocks are too skinny and unstable to stand on when stood up, so you won’t be able to stand on them.
